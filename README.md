# My neovim config

My neovim config simply is just a lazyvim and with extra plugins, that's it.

## Installation

```
mv ~/.config/nvim{,.bak}
```
Take backup of existing neovim config

```
rm -rf ~/.config/nvim
```

Or just delete it

--


```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/samet404/My-neovim-config ~/.config/nvim && rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/.git
```
Simply clones the repo with shallow clone and removes the .git from it.
